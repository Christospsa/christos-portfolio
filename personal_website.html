          <p><strong>AB VASSILOPOULOS · Full-time</strong></p>
          <p><em>Feb 2024 – Aug 2024 · Athens · On-Site</em></p>
          <p>At AB Vassilopoulos (a member of Ahold Delhaize), 
            I was part of the QA team ensuring the reliability and performance of the e-commerce ecosystem, including the website, mobile app, and in-store kiosks. My responsibilities included writing and executing detailed test cases, identifying bugs across environments, and supporting both regression and user acceptance testing (UAT). I worked daily in a Scrum-based environment with international development teams, participating in agile ceremonies and using JIRA for issue tracking and coordination.

            To manage system incidents and resolve internal and customer-reported issues, I also utilized ServiceNow as part of the support workflow. Tools such as SAP and NCR were integral in verifying POS and kiosk systems functionality. 
            My testing contributions helped ensure smooth rollouts and platform stability across multiple digital touchpoints.</p>

          <p><em>Aprl 2023 – Feb 2024 · Athens · On-Site</em></p>
          <p>At Upcom Minds, I held a hybrid role spanning both digital marketing and front-end development. On the marketing side, I was responsible for managing and analyzing performance across various social media platforms.

            I also worked within HubSpot CRM, performing contact segmentation, campaign performance evaluation, and customer journey mapping. 
            I created dashboards and tracked key metrics like email open rates, conversion paths, and lead scores to help refine campaign effectiveness and overall CRM strategy.
            
            In parallel, I was involved in the development and maintenance of websites for internal use and clients, ensuring they were visually engaging, responsive, and aligned with marketing goals. My responsibilities included updating content, troubleshooting issues, and improving UI components for usability and performance.</p>
